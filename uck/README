Intro
=====
The scripts included here can be used to custom build the OD-server

Usage
=====
apt-get install uck
git clone https://github.com/March-hare/Operator-Distribution.git
cd Operator-Distribution
wget http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso
echo 'c396dd0f97bd122691bdb92d7e68fde5 *ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso' | md5sum -c
sudo uck-remaster ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso `pwd`/uck `pwd` | tee -a remaster.log

The finished OD-server iso will be in remaster-new-files

Limitations
===========
- Only Ubuntu 10.04.2 Desktop is supported right now.
- Do not have anything listening on port 10000 (webmin) when running 
uck-remaster
- You will need to have an internet connection when running these scripts.
- uck-remaster needs to be run as root.  This means the generated iso will be
owned by root.  You may have to change permissions on it to use with other
tools.
