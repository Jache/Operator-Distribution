Intro
=====
The scripts included here can be used to custom build the OD-server

Usage
=====
apt-get install uck
git clone https://github.com/March-hare/Operator-Distribution.git
cd Operator-Distribution
wget http://mirrors.us.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases/10.04.2/ubuntu-10.04.2-desktop-i386.iso
uck-remaster ubuntu-10.04.2-desktop-i386.iso `pwd`/uck `pwd`

The finished OD-server iso will be in remaster-new-files

Limitations
===========
- Only Ubuntu 10.04.2 Desktop is supported right now.
- Do not have anything listening on port 10000 (webmin) when running 
uck-remaster
- You will need to have an internet connection when running these scripts.
- uck-remaster needs to be run as root.  This means the generated iso will be
owned by root.  You may have to change permissions on it to use with other
tools.
